# Getting started with Spotify.ahk

To download or get the latist version, visit the [Spotify.ahk Github page](https://github.com/CloakerSmoker/Spotify.ahk).

## Requirements
* `Autohotkey_L` - Which can be found [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
* `Spotify Premium` - While not required for all functionality, some things might require a premium account (which will be noted on a per-page basis)
* Theorically, nothing else. All libraries Spotify.ahk requires are packaged with the download

I forgot this page existed, just click through the playlist and track stuff
