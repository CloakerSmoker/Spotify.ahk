# Spotify.ahk (rewrite)

Disclaimer: Some features of Spotify.ahk will not work for non-premium users, this is not a limition of Spotify.ahk, but a limit in Spotify's Connect Web API as stated in its documentation.
```
Note:
  With Connect Web API you can only control Spotify Premium usersâ€™ playback.
``` 

A rewritten version of my original AutoHotkey wrapper for the Spotify web API.
The rewrite is not 100% complete yet, and the documentation isn't complete either, but both the rewrite itself and rewrite docs are more developed than the originals.
Currently the rewrite has a lot of debug code left in, and is not intended for full use. However, I don't plan on making any big changes besides those listed in the docs, and methods will only be added/patched from now on.

Uses a slightly modified version of the [AHKhttp library by zhamlin](https://github.com/zhamlin/AHKhttp), and the [AHKsock library by jleb](https://github.com/jleb/AHKsock).

#### How to use
See the [documentation](https://cloakersmoker.github.io/Spotify.ahk/rewrite/index.html) or example scripts.
